User interface
==============

EYE uses by default only one window but it's possible to use multiple windows thanks to scripting. See :doc:`eye.widgets.window`.

Each EYE window can be split horizontally or vertically, and each split part can be also split, recursively. See :doc:`shortcuts` and :doc:`eye.widgets.splitter`.

Each split can contain multiple tabs. By default, opening a new file will add a new tab in current split zone. See :doc:`eye.widgets.tabs`.

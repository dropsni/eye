EYE - Edit Your Editor
======================

.. all EYE documentation that does not come from Python docs, Qt docs, Scintilla or QScintilla docs are licensed
.. under the WTFPLv2 license. See COPYING.txt for details.

EYE is a Qt based text/code editor designed to be modular and scriptable in Python.
It comes with a minimal default configuration but a number of plugins.

Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   intro
   ui
   configuration
   shortcuts
   plugins
   qt


Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`


.. note::

   If you're reading the modules documentation on readthedocs.org, there may be glitches (like seeing `<Mock ...>`)
   due to the fact that readthedocs builds the docs **without** Qt support so there is hacks to workaround it (quite
   harshly).
   The best way to view the documentation is to build it on the local machine and view from there.
